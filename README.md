# TEE-ACM2
Transformations for Energy Efficient Accelerated Chain Matrix Multiplication

## Compile :
* $> module load cuda cmake 
* $> mkdir BUILD && cd BUILD && cmake ..
* $> make

## Execute:
* ./mat_test -n -k -run
* n : number of matrices to compute
* k : kernel to launch
*       0 : TEE-ACM2
*       1 : cuBLAS using the OP_Count Tree
*       2 : cuBLAS in order
* run : parameter to generate the sizes

## CUDA kernels:
### cupy.cuh
* Fast implementation (5% close to cuBLAS) for single matrix multiplication
* Manually overlap communication and computation (copy data from global memory to registers for the next iteration while computing the current one)
### tee_acm.cuh
* Energy efficient implementation for single matrix multiplication (up to 10% energy savings)
* No overlap
### fused_left_mat_mult.cuh
* Fused kernel implementation (80% slower than running two cuBLAS kernels)
* Each thread in a CUDA thread block compute an entire row of the final R tile
* Atomic adds to the global memory
### no_atomic_adds_left_mat_mult.cuh
* Fused kernel implementation (500% slower than running two cuBLAS kernels)
* Each thread in a CUDA thread block compute an entire row of the final R matrix 
* No atomic operations
* Occupancy problems
